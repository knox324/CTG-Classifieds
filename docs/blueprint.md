## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust and modernity.
- Background color: A very light blue (#F0F8FF) to provide a clean and airy feel, in alignment with the glassmorphism aesthetic.
- Accent color: A light green (#90EE90) to complement the primary blue, for interactive elements like the WhatsApp button and color picker.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its modern and neutral appearance. It is well-suited for both headlines and body text.
- Implement a clean, minimalistic design with a focus on photography. Use the glassmorphism effect to create a premium feel. Prioritize negative space to enhance clarity.
- Use simple, elegant icons to represent categories and actions, aligning with the minimalistic design.
- Incorporate subtle animations for a modern touch (e.g., color transitions on the customizable theme). Keep the animations smooth and performant to maintain a premium experience.
